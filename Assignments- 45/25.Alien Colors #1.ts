// Task 25
//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign 
//ita value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message
// that the player just earned 5 points.

//• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. 
//(The version that fails will have no output.)
